# UI Design Creation Rules

## When user says "create new design":

1. **File Creation**: Create a new .tsx file in the `Designes/` folder
2. **Naming Convention**: Use `ui_{n}.tsx` where n = highest existing number in Designes/ + 1
   - Current files: ui_1.tsx, ui_2.tsx
   - Next file should be: ui_3.tsx (and so on)
3. **Calculate Next Number**:
   - Check all files matching pattern `ui_*.tsx` in Designes/ folder
   - Find the highest number and add 1
   - Examples: ui_1.tsx, ui_2.tsx â†’ next is ui_3.tsx
4. **Reference Images**: If an image is provided in the chat, use it as reference to create the UI design
5. **File Structure**: Follow React Native/Expo component structure with TypeScript
